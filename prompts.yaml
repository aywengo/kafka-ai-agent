    detection_rules: |
      Check for these breaking changes:
      1. Field removal without deprecation
      2. Field type changes (except widening)
      3. Required field additions without defaults
      4. Enum value removals
      5. Field name changes
      6. Namespace modifications
      7. Logical type changes
      
    fix_suggestions: |
      For each breaking change, suggest fixes:
      - If field removed: Add deprecation period or provide default
      - If type changed: Consider union types or aliases
      - If required added: Provide sensible default value
      - If enum modified: Use aliases or extend only
      - Provide code examples where applicable
